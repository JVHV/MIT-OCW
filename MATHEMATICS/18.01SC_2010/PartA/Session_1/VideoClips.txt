Geometric Interpretation of Differentation

Find the tangent line to y=f(x)
	@ P=(x0,y0)


1. Graph Function, draw tangent line  (lol)

A tangent line is y-y0 = m(x-x0)
point y0=f(x0)
slope m or f'(x0)  f prime of x zero

Def'n  f'(x0), the derivative
of f at x0 is the slope of the tangent line to y=f(x) at P.

Q. How do we know which line is the tangent line?  
A. Tangent line = Limit of Secant lines PQ as Q->P  (Q tends to P)
